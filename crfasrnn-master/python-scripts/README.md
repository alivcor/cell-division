This model is for the ICCV paper titled "Conditional Random Fields as Recurrent Neural Networks". 

With this model, you should get 73.0 mean-IOU score on a reduced validation set(346 Images http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~szheng/Res_CRFRNN/seg12valid.txt) on PASCAL VOC 2012. Notice that without this CRF-RNN layer, our end-to-end-trained FCN-8s model gives 69.85 mean-IOU score (mean pix. accuracy:92.94, pixel accuracy: 78.80) on the this reduced validation set of PASCAL VOC 2012.

The input is expected in BGR color channel order, with the following per-channel mean substracted:
B: 104.00698793 G: 116.66876762 R: 122.67891434
