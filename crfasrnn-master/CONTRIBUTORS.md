Our code uses the [Permutohedral lattice library](http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/permutohedral/), and the [Caffe future version](https://github.com/longjon/caffe/tree/future).
We also used parts of the [Dense CRF code](http://www.philkr.net/home/densecrf) while implementing this.

Permutohedral lattice library (BSD license) is from Andrew Adams, Jongmin Baek, Abe Davis. Fast High-Dimensional Filtering Using the 
Permutohedral Lattice. Eurographics 2010.
DenseCRF library is from from Philipp Krahenbuhl and Vladlen Koltun. Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials. 
NIPS 2011.

Our software is built on top of the Caffe software library. Below is a copy of its CONTRIBUTORS.md file.
Please note that, due to technical difficulties, we could not keep the history of the original contributors to Caffe code in our git repository.
